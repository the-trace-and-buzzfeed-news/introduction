# Unsolved Shootings — Data, Code, and Methodologies

![chart-collage](chart-collage.png "chart-collage")


To gain a deeper understanding of America's unsolved-shootings crisis, [The Trace](https://www.thetrace.org/) and [BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/) analyzed data from three historical FBI datasets, along with internal data obtained from 22 police departments. We also conducted a detailed analysis of Baltimore shooting victim and suspects. You can read about our main findings here:

We have also published detailed data, code, and methodologies to support those findings:

## Analysis of Police Department Data

*We standardized and analyzed internal data from 22 municipal police departments to examine present-day trends in arrest rates.*
